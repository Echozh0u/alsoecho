<h1>About Also Echo</h1>
<p>
My website will republish the poems and essays I wrote in high school,and the video, music which build my memory. My inspiration for high school writing came mainly from my school experiences and daily life. I decided to name each piece after a symbolic object to add an extra layer of meaning to my work. 
</p>
<p>

I also pay great attention to Chinese words and phrases in my poetry. As a native Chinese speaker, I find these words and phrases add unique depth and meaning to my work. By incorporating these elements into my poetry, I hope to create a richer reading experience for my readers.
</p>
<p>

In order to give my poetry a new twist, I have also been repackaging my work in a new way. This involves rearranging the words on the page to create a new reading experience.
</p>
<p>
I've been out of high school for two years, and I've gone from 15 when I started writing to 20. I can always feel confused by my own words, but I also can better deal with the confusion of a few years ago. I hope to learn more about myself through the re-release of my past work, and I hope that other teenagers who are just as confused as I can gain energy from my work.
