<h1>About Echo</h1>
<p>
When I was in high school, I was a sentimental girl, I often had emotional ups and downs because of trifles in life and study. So during that period I often felt very happy because of small things, but also painful because of a few words. My high school days are the most precious memories in my life. At that time, I did not have too many worries. What I thought most every day was what to eat for lunch and whether the teacher would call my name in the next class.<br><br> Now, at the age of 20, I start to think more about my future, career and relationships.
At 20, Echo is no longer as carefree as she was at 16, and things that once seemed so big don't seem so important now.
And every age experience is made up of me now, I will always miss the past, thank the past.
